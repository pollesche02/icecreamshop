# icecreamshop

This app allows you to pick your favorite ice cream. At the top of the screen you will notice a fill in the blank placeholder asking you
to fill in your favorite kind of ice cream, then click the button to the left of it. You will notice that the ice cream you choose will
be added to the botton right list. At this point lets say you want to save it for another day so you don't forget what you favorite 
kind of ice cream was. Simply click on the "save" button next to that ice cream flavor and you will notice that your ice cream choice will
move over to the list on the right. That's it Your all done. Great Job ! 

I was able to use Giphy in this project it was able to add a nice movement to the app. 

When I was coding the app I was able to learn more on different routes and how to apply them a little easier and with better coding techniques.
